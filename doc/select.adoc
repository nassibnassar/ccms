===== Description

The `select` command retrieves a list of objects from a set according
to specified criteria.

[discrete]
===== Parameters

The first argument specifies `*` meaning all available attributes.

[discrete]
====== from

The `from` clause specifies the desired set that will be the source of
data.

[discrete]
====== where

The `where` clause specifies a search condition in the form of a
Boolean expression.  Only objects that satisfy this condition will be
retrieved.

See also *Reference > Queries*.

[discrete]
====== order by

The `order by` clause specifies a sort order for objects to be
returned.  The objects are sorted by the specified `*_attribute_*`,
with `asc` for ascending order (the default) or `desc` for descending
order.

[discrete]
====== limit

The `limit` clause specifies a maximum number of objects that will be
returned.

NOTE:  At present the `limit` clause is required for `select`.

[discrete]
====== offset

The `offset` clause specifies a number of objects that will be skipped
and not returned as part of the result.  This can be useful for
retrieving objects one page of data a time.  Note that the `order by`
clause is required when `offset` is used.

===== Examples

To retrieve items in stock from the set `test.myset`:

----
select * from test.myset where availability = 'In stock' order by title;
----
