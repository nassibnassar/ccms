=== Protocol

Non-query commands such as `create set` return a diagnostic status:

[source,json]
----
{
  "command": "create set test.myset;"
}
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "create set"
}
----

The status may be an error:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "set test.myset already exists"
}
----

Query commands such as `select` also return tabular data sets, with
the attribute names described under `"fields"`, e.g.:

[source,json]
----
{
  "command": "select id from test.myset;"
}
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "select",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "id"
    }
  ],
  "data": [
    [
      "053e4063-d70c-4a41-a968-e6900e6b47d5"
    ],
    [
      "ac256496-111a-4e13-9d3b-a55ac3d0f676"
    ]
  ]
}
----

NOTE:  Selecting individual attributes, as in the example above, is
not yet supported.  However, `select *` is supported.
