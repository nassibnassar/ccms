|Description

|Object
|object
|
|An object is a bibliographic record.

|List
|set
list
|create set
delete
insert
retrieve
show sets
|A set is an unordered collection of objects.  A list is an ordered
collection of objects.  Sets are the primary data structure in
CCMS; however, query commands such as `retrieve` or
`show sets` return a list.

|Profile
|filter
|define filter
show filters
|A filter defines rules for selecting objects from sets.

|Marker
|tag
|define tag
add tag
remove tag
show tags
|A tag is a label that can be assigned to selected objects in sets.
|===

Filters are applied using the `filter` keyword, e.g.:

----
define filter f where date >= "01-01-2025"

create set s

insert into s from reserve filter f
----

Tags use the `tag` keyword:

----
define tag t

add tag t on s where date >= "02-01-2025" and date < "03-01-2025"

retrieve isbn from s tag t
----

Multiple tags can be listed, separated by commas:

----
retrieve isbn from s tag t, u, not v, w
----

=== Protocol

Non-query commands return a diagnostic status:

----
{
  "commands": [
    "create set myset"
  ]
}
----

----
{
  [
    { 
      "status": "create set"
    }
  ]
}
----

Query commands such as `retrieve` also return tabular data sets, e.g.:

----
{
  "commands": [
    "retrieve id from myset"
  ]
}
----

----
{
  [
    {
      "status": "retrieve",
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "id"
        }
      ],
      "data": [
        [
          "053e4063-d70c-4a41-a968-e6900e6b47d5"
        ],
        [
          "ac256496-111a-4e13-9d3b-a55ac3d0f676"
        ]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

=== Commands

==== add tag

Add a tag to objects in a set

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]

The `where` clause specifies a condition in the form of a Boolean
expression.  Only objects that satisfy this condition will be tagged.

[discrete]
====== filter

The `filter` clause applies a specified filter to the objects that
will be tagged.

[discrete]
===== Examples

To add a tag `t` to objects in a set `s` selected by a filter `f`:
