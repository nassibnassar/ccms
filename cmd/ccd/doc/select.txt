select

Retrieve objects from a set

select *
    from set_name
    [ where condition ]
    [ order by attribute [ asc | desc ] ]
    [ limit count ]

Description

The select command retrieves a list of objects from a set according to
specified criteria.

Parameters

The first argument specifies * meaning all available attributes.

from

The from clause specifies the desired set that will be the source of data.

where

The where clause specifies a condition in the form of a Boolean expression.
Only objects that satisfy this condition will be retrieved.

Note Currently the only supported form of condition is attribute = 'value'.

order by

The order by clause specifies a sort order for objects to be returned. The
objects are sorted by the specified attribute, with asc for ascending order
(the default) or desc for descending order.

limit

The limit clause specifies a maximum number of objects that will be returned.

     At present the CCMS server returns a maximum of 30 records to the client,
Note even if a higher maximum is specified using limit. This maximum applies
     only to the select command; it does not apply to the insert command, which
     does not return records to the client.

Examples

To retrieve items in stock from the set test.myset:

select * from test.myset where availability = 'In stock' order by title;
