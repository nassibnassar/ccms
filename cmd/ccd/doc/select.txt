select

Retrieve objects from a set

select *
    from set_name
    [ where search_condition ]
    [ order by attribute [ asc | desc ] ]
    [ limit count ]
    [ offset start ]

Description

The select command retrieves a list of objects from a set according to
specified criteria.

Parameters

The first argument specifies * meaning all available attributes.

from

The from clause specifies the desired set that will be the source of data.

where

The where clause specifies a search condition in the form of a Boolean
expression. Only objects that satisfy this condition will be retrieved.

See also Reference > Queries.

order by

The order by clause specifies a sort order for objects to be returned. The
objects are sorted by the specified attribute, with asc for ascending order
(the default) or desc for descending order.

limit

The limit clause specifies a maximum number of objects that will be returned.

     At present the CCMS server returns a maximum of 30 records to the client,
Note even if a higher maximum is specified using limit. This maximum applies
     only to the select command; it does not apply to the insert command, which
     does not return records to the client.

offset

The offset clause specifies a number of objects that will be skipped and not
returned as part of the result. This can be useful for retrieving objects one
page of data a time. Note that the order by clause is required whenever offset
is used.

Examples

To retrieve items in stock from the set test.myset:

select * from test.myset where availability = 'In stock' order by title;
