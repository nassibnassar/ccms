select

Retrieve objects from a set

select *
    from set_name
    [ where condition ]
    [ limit count ]

Description

The select command retrieves a list of objects from a set according to
specified criteria.

Parameters

The first argument specifies * meaning all available attributes.

from

The from clause specifies the desired set that will be the source of data.

where

The where clause specifies a condition in the form of a Boolean expression.
Only objects that satisfy this condition will be retrieved.

Note Currently the only supported form of condition is attribute = 'value'.

limit

The limit clause specifies a maximum number of objects that will be returned.

     At present the CCMS server returns a maximum of 30 records to the client,
Note even if a higher maximum is specified using limit. This maximum applies
     only to the select command; it does not apply to the insert command, which
     does not return records to the client.

Examples

To retrieve items in stock from the set test.myset:

select * from test.myset where availability = 'In stock';
